# G+ Data
---

All data retrieved using the [American Soccer Analysis API](https://app.americansocceranalysis.com/api/v1/__docs__/#).

Credit for all data also goes to [American Soccer Analysis](https://americansocceranalysis.com). This repo is meant to be a weekly cache of G+ percentiles subdivided by each applicable action type at every position. You can retrieve this same data via ASA's [Shiny app](https://api.americansocceranalysis.com), but I wanted something more automated for future projects.

Allocation money data was built with data from Spotrac + various data sources for league allocations (including SBNation blogs - linked in the notebooks, the 2015-19 CBA, and wikipedia).
