Caveats
---

If using this data for any purpose, please keep in mind the following caveats:

- not considering transfers that were converted into GAM (too many of those)
- assuming that all CCL/Leagues Cup allocations were 200k
- assuming all trades after the secondary window closed involved GAM for the following season (need to double-check these)
- assuming all trades before the secondary window closed involved GAM for the current season (need to double-check these)
- no 2020-present CBA in hand so base GAM/TAM amounts are from SounderAtHeart and one random Charlotte FC team blog post
- league allocations post-old CBA are based on the old CBA
- trades accurate as of July 1, 2022. last one in the set is ATL getting its international spots from NSH and SEA
- assumes all performance bonuses have been triggered
- made some assumptions about how AM were distributed across multiple years where it wasn't clear (ex: LAFC's trade for Crepeau)
- all of this data was manually collected and edited, so human error applies
